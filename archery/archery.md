*Abstract*

*The following rules and regulations govern the archery event of HuroCup, a robotic game and robotics benchmark problem for humanoid robots.*

**Latest Version of the Rules for HuroCup**

The latest official version of the rules of the game for HuroCup is always available from the [HuroCup Facebook Page](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/groups/hurocup&sa=D&ust=1514088107603000&usg=AFQjCNGMLYX_nMp8mpc63GHxdyN9em8Z7Q).

**Archery**

The goal of the archery competition is to encourage research into humanoid robots that are able to do compliant control precisely.

**HuroCup Archery - Laws of the Game**

The following laws describe the specifics of the archery event. For general specifications relevant to all HuroCup events (e.g., robot dimensions, playing field and lighting, responsibility of the referees) please refer to [General - HuroCup Laws of the Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/15laUlB6uZ56J5WpGPhepb7P8O7ul-8K5sgdf4uwu4Ak/pub&sa=D&ust=1514088107604000&usg=AFQjCNEECNgGWwMUepFDt2Ca_rcGDK_uHQ).

HuroCup Archery playing field and target board

$D is the height of target board center from ground. The minimum size of the playing field is 4m by 3m.

[A-1.2] : The target board is separated into three circles in different color.  The robot shooting arrow at different circles gets different score points.
