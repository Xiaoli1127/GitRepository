>>Abstract
>>The following rules and regulations govern the penalty kick event of HuroCup, a robotic game and robotics benchmark problem for humanoid robots.

# Latest Version of the Rules for HuroCup
The latest official version of the rules of the game for HuroCup is always available from the HuroCup Facebook Page.
# Changes to the Penalty Kick rules of HuroCup
There are no significant changes to the penalty kick laws for 2015.
# Penalty Kick
In the penalty kick challenge, the robot must approach a ball, dribble it through a set of simulated defenders into the shooting zone and then kick it past a simulated goal keeper into the goal.
# HuroCup Penalty Kick - Laws of the Game
The following laws describe the specifics of the penalty kick event. For general specifications relevant to all HuroCup events (e.g., robot dimensions, playing field and lighting, responsibility of the referees) please refer to General - HuroCup Laws of the Game.


# [PK-1]: Field of Play
#### [PK-1.1]: The dimensions of the playing field are at least 250 cm by 250 cm.
#### [PK-1.2]: One side of the playing field contains a goal. This side of the playing field is called the goal side. The opposite side of  the playing field is called the empty side. The two other sides are called touch lines. See Figure Penalty Kick Field of Play for more details and dimensions. All dimensions are approximate and small variations may occur.

>## [PK-7]: Game Play  
>[PK-7.1]: One robot is designated the kicker and another robot or a static robot is designated the goalkeeper. All other robots must be positioned behind the centre line and must not interfere with the designated kicker or goalkeeper in any way.  
>[PK-7.2]: The only robots allowed to move during a penalty kick are the designated kicker and the goalkeeper.  
>[PK-7.3]: Each robot may have at most one human handler associated with it.

>[PK-7.5]: A human handler may only enter the playing field or touch his/her robot with the permission of the referee. The kick will be declared invalid if the handler touches the robot.  
>[PK-7.6]: The referee will place the ball $D away from the goal line centered along the goal line and the kicker is placed behind the ball.  
>[PK-7.7]: The kicker robot must be at the start point at the beginning of the competition. The start point for small and large robots is directly behind the ball facing the goal.  
>[PK-7.8]: The designated goalkeeper must be positioned so that a part of the robot touches the goal line at the start of the game.  
>[PK-7.9]: Three wall obstacles as described in [Obstacle Run - HuroCup Laws of the Game (Wall Obstacles)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JF4hpEZ4fg_3BNnBojY3ZAYBdgUDpfGaB_MJusSJ5-8/edit%23bookmark%3Did.j3tqeox07col&sa=D&ust=1514003531771000&usg=AFQjCNH79WmXYNWcj7OGNnqEFvjTDSjL0Q) will be placed $OD away from the goal line. One obstacle is centered along the goal line and the other two obstacles are placed so that the distance between obstacles is at least $OC.  
>[PK-7.10]: Two additional defender obstacles are placed at random inside the shooting zone. The defenders are black paper cutouts with a maximum width of 30cm and a maximum height of 60cm.  
>[PK-7.11]: The kicker must move the ball from the start point into the shooting zone without touching any of the obstacles or defenders. Once the ball is completely inside the shooting zone, the kicker must kick the ball into the goal.  
>[PK-7.12]: The designated kicker is not allowed to leave the playing field or to enter the goal area. A robot has entered the goal area if any part of the robot’s foot touches the goal area line or the goal area itself.  
>[PK-7.13]: The designated kicker is not allowed to touch any obstacle.  
>[PK-7.14]: The designated goalkeeper is not allowed to leave the goal area. A robot has left the goal area if any part of the robot’s foot touches the goal area line or the goal area itself.  
>[PK-7.15]: The designated goalkeeper must remain in a standard walking posture until the ball has been kicked at the goal. The goalkeeper may only squat or block a large part of the goal until after the ball has been kicked at the goal.  
>[PK-7.16]: During the time between the start of the penalty kick and the time that the ball has been kicked at the goal, the robot may move freely in the goal area as long as it remains completely inside of the goal area and in a standard walking posture.

>* or the ball moved outside of the playing field,  
>* or a robot is immobilized by a technical defect,

>* or a robot touches an obstacle,  
>* or the maximum duration of the competition (2 minutes) has elapsed.  
>[PK-7.20]: After the end of the penalty kick, the next robot is designated the kicker.

># [PK-8]: Method of Scoring  
>[PK-8.1]: There are five tries in one round of the competition. Each try consists of all robots being designated the runner exactly once. Each robot receives one point for each try in which it manages to score a goal.  
>[PK-8.2]: Any robot that has not scored a goal at least once is automatically awarded no rank and 0 points.  
>[PK-8.3]: Among the robots that have scored at least one goal, the robots are ranked (i.e., 1st place, 2nd place) based on the greater number of goals scored.  
>[PK-8.4]: In case of a tie, i.e., more than one robot having scored the same number of goals, the robots will be ranked based on the total time required to score all goals.  
>For more details about the point allocation, please refer to [Point Allocation [Organization - HuroCup Laws of the Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kn2_dtNp65n1j5TjZWJVIlTKRFcNkTSpARkdhLHNA1c/edit%23bookmark%3Did.rzzlothp76e9&sa=D&ust=1514003531775000&usg=AFQjCNFVIkFXetxWA2rfK3NblBbinxZulg).  

># [PK-9]: Tiebreaker  
>[PK-9.1]: In case two or more robots have the same number of points after all rounds in the penalty kick event, the sum of the goals in all rounds will be used a tiebreaker.  
>[PK-9.2]: In case two or more robots have the same number of points after all rounds and are still tied after applying the previous tiebreaker, the maximum number of goals in a single round will be used as tiebreaker.  
>[PK-9.3]: In case two or more robots are still tied after applying the previous tiebreaker, the time for the maximum number of goals in a single round will be used as tiebreaker.
