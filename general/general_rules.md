*The following rules and regulations are general rules of HuroCup, a robotic game and robotics benchmark problem for humanoid robots. The HuroCup competition emphasizes the development of flexible, robust, and versatile robots that can perform many different tasks in different domains.  HuroCup encourages research into the many areas of humanoid robotics, especially walking and balancing, complex motion planning, and human robot interaction. In addition to the single events (e.g., archery, sprint, marathon, united soccer, obstacle run, long jump, spartan race, marathon, weightlifting, and basketball), there is an all-round competition for the single robot that performs best over all events.*

##Latest Version of the Rules for HuroCup

The latest official version of the rules of the game for HuroCup is always available from the [HuroCup Facebook Page.](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/groups/hurocup&sa=D&ust=1514130922371000&usg=AFQjCNF88GqMLVbEBQqczVzRylYrlQYbzQ)
##Changes to the General Rules of HuroCup

There are no significant changes to the general rules of HuroCup in the 2015 competition.
##Mission Statement

The goal of the HuroCup league is to encourage research in practical, autonomous, highly mobile, flexible, and versatile robotic platforms. Intended applications for these robots are, among others, search and rescue robots, healthcare robots, intelligent household helper robots, etc.

As a benchmark problem, the goal of the HuroCup league is to develop humanoid robots that can perform several tasks in complex environments.
##Physical Challenge Events

To reduce the steep learning curve toward fully autonomous humanoid robots, the rules committee has developed several challenge events for the different leagues.

These challenges are aimed at providing intermediate goals on the path to fully autonomous robots that can operate in challenging environments.

The following subsections describe each individual event briefly. These challenges are conducted using the corresponding laws for equivalent human events as much as possible. For example, the United Soccer laws are based on the FIFA Laws of the Game. See [Laws of the Game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15laUlB6uZ56J5WpGPhepb7P8O7ul-8K5sgdf4uwu4Ak/pub#id.mw3kjcu13jii) for more details. Unless otherwise specified, the laws of the corresponding human equivalent game apply.

**Basketball**

The basketball competition is a single robot event at the moment, but will be expanded to multiple players in the future. The robot must throw a ball into a coloured target. For detailed rules of the basketball event please refer to [Basketball - HuroCup Laws of the Game](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nGPXJio0P49PecHr4EyEZewPgMYz9ZPp0Qbfq3g5HE/pub&sa=D&ust=1514130922373000&usg=AFQjCNF40R8c9v77B1kjc9fZC3JVnLA9Bw).
